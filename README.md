# Making Embedded Systems Final Project

## 1. Application description
The project is digital barometer with algorithm that predicts the oncoming storms. Device sleeps with the screen off until one of the two things happen:
1. Device is picked up and handled
2. Storm is detected

Accelerometer and gyro will assist in detecting that the device was picked up and would also detect the orientation of the device. 
In case of storm the device would periodically light up a screen and would diplay a short warning about the oncoming storm.
The algorithm for detecting of storms would read the trend of the atmospheric pressure during last 6 or 12 hours and would interpret the results

## 2. Hardware description
Device is assembled out of DISCO-F429ZI development board and the small "shield" attached to it. The sheild is carrying the accelerometer and the barometer.
Following sensors are used in addition to the gyro already supplied by the board:
- [LPS28DFW](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lps28dfw.html#documentation) Dual full-scale, 1260 hPa and 4060 hPa, absolute digital output barometer with water-resistant package 
- [MMA8653FC](https://www.nxp.com/products/sensors/accelerometers/2g-4g-8g-low-g-10-bit-digital-accelerometer:MMA8653FC) 10-Bit Digital Accelerometer
- [MMA8652FC](https://www.nxp.com/products/sensors/accelerometers/2g-4g-8g-low-g-12-bit-digital-accelerometer:MMA8652FC) 12-Bit Digital Accelerometer

PCB was designed and ordered but were late to arrive so I had to etch my own PCB at home. As accelerometer and the barometer are usually QFN/DFN or some custom footprint that are
hard to etch and solder at home I used the brakeout board for the MMA8653FC that I had on hand but later I shifted to MMA8652FC once the board arrived. 
Because of this the code contains the version for both accelerometers. 

Below is the schematic of the final PCB that was used:

## 3. Software description
Code uses the main control loop which handles the majority of the logic of the device. Below are main parts of the software:
1. Main code contained in `main.c`
    - The code in `main.c` has initially been generated by the STMCube code generation and was then completed with custom functions
2. Additional modules:
    - lv_widgets.c - This module contains logic for the handling of the LCD
    - retarget.c - This module contains code which is used to output the data to serial console
3. HAL code generated by the STMCube code generating addon
    - All of the HAL code has been generated by STMCube program, the setup was carried out in the graphical interface

#### Description of the states
- ON               - Initial state, all variables are reset and device started
- SLEEP            - State in which device loops with screen off waiting for the timer or movement/input
- MEASURE          - Measuring, this can be done in the background with ADC trough the timer
- DISPLAY_PRESSURE - Standard display pressure mode in which the device is displaying pressure in portrait mode
- DISPLAY_TREND    - Display pressure trend (graph) in last 6 hours in portait mode
- DISPLAY_WARNING  - Warning: pressure trend has shown that the storm might be approacing
- ERROR            - Some of the parameters of pressures is out of bounds, reset the device

#### Description of the events
- Timer             - Timer has run out and the device will either take measurement or display value
- Move              - Movement has been detected and device will react to that by showing the screen
- Tilt-Portait      - Device was set in portait orientation so display standard screen with preesure value
- Tilt-Landscpe     - Device was set in landscape mode so show the graph with pressure trend
- Button            - Button was pressed - activate the screen
- Warning           - Pressure trend indicates that the storm is approaching
- Describe the parts you wrote in some detail (maybe 3-5 sentences per module)
- Describe code you re-used from other sources, including the licenses for those

## 5. Build instructions

### 5.1 How to build the system 
#### Hardware
In order to build the hardware for the system a PCB was developed to plug into the Disco board. There are two version of the PCB:
- Version made to be etched and used with MMA8653FC accelerometer soldered onto the brakeout board: ![Etched board](https://github.com/tdarlic/making-embedded-systems/tree/main/etched-disco-board-pcb)
- Version ordered from the PCB fab house ![Fab house PCB](https://github.com/tdarlic/making-embedded-systems/tree/main/disco-board-pcb)

In order to build the hardware PCB should be made, accelerometer and barometer chips should be ordered and soldered to the board. Passive elements are not so important and any close value part 
can be used as they are used as pull-up or pull-down or as bypass capacitors. 

#### Software
In order to build the software the system needs to be pulled from the GitHub together with submodules:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tdarlic/mes-final-project`

Command above will clone the complete project and pull all required submodules. After cloning the project it can be loaded in the STM32CubeIDE (Version 1.9.0 was used to develop the project)

### 5.2 How you debugged and tested the system

## 6. Future
### What would be needed to get this project ready for production
To be viable digital barometer following should be considered:
* Size of the screen needed for the project if screen needed at all
* Minimum viable MCU for the project
* Battery power required
* PCB design and development
* Hardware and software tests required
* Enclosure design and production
* CE and FCC testing
### How would you extend this project to do something more? Are there other features youâ€™d like?
This project could be made much smaller as a keychain for example so that it just warns user of the possible storm without any screen. It could maybe vibrate or have just a few status leds. 
Or, we can go different direction and have this as a part of the weather station project with the larger screen (possible e-paper) and with additional sensors. Sensors could be made remote using
BLM or similar wireless technology.
### How would you go about adding them?
I would rather prefer this to be small wearable project which could be part of a keychain or would be installed on a small boat with long lasting battery and would just flash or vibrate to 
warn that the storm is approaching. With the modern mobile phones usability of this device is really limited in the current form. 

## 7. Grading
| Criteria | Self Grade | Comments |
|----------|------------|----------|
|Meets Minimum Goals| 2 | I2C for the LCD, UART for the console, I2C for the accelerometer and barometer, push button for exiting sleep, interrupt for the button and the accelerometer|
|Completeness of deliverables| 2 | It's far less than I wanted to create, basics are there|
|Clear intentions and working code| 2 | The code functions, barely. It was written in a single day and a day of testing and there was a lot improvements that can be done, |
|Reusing code| 2 | A lot of code was resued, I used several libraries, for circular buffer, accelerometer, barometer, and lvgl for display, also the command console was completely reused|
|Originality and scope of goals| 1 | The idea is not original at all. My problem was the time which was very limited I knew that I might pull of this and not much more|
